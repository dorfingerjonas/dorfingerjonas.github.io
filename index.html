      <div id='aboutContent'>
        <div class='partOfAbout'>
          <p>I am a web designer and photographer with three years of coding & design experience. My knowledge in project management, design, coding, and strengths in social communication makes my way to work.</p>
          <p>To get new ideas and support my creativity I spend a lot of time in the mountains with skiing. Sometimes, my best ideas grow while running in the morning around my hometown. The most effective time to work for me is in the morning. For me, it is the best time to continue completing tasks to achieve my daily goals.</p>
          <p>I take my motivation from satisfied customers or colleagues which I work with. A motivating impulse is to see the completed product, especially the moment you get a smile or just a simple 'Thank you' from other people. </p>
          <p>I believe learning by doing is the most effective way to get into new stuff. This mentality helped me to enhance my skill and always keep improving. I am currently a student who is interested in new challenges. Do not hesitate, contact me using the contact form on this page.</p>

              <p>Tic Tac Toe is a well-known game, I decided to create my own game, three gamemodes to make the game more attractive. You are able to play the game alone against a bot (gamemode in progress), you can play online with your friend in realtime. It's also possible to play TicTacToe on one device with two people. This game is only a fun project in my leisure time, I wanted to use this project to learn more about online game development an database-client communication.  <a href='https://dorfingerjonas.github.io/TicTacToe/'>Website</a><i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i></p>

As part of the semester project in the 11th grade, this project was developed in cooperation with the association. The benefit of this page is, that the club members can upload files and share them. Another feature is the comment functionality, they can start discussions. I have been chosen as the project manager of the three-man team, all of them are colleagues of me. <a href='https://htldirav.net/'>Website</a><i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i></p>

              <p>I have created my own calendar, inspired by the Google Calendar. I focused my work on the functionality of the application. 'Calendar' was a learning by doing project for me. Before the app, I had nearly no clue about using Date and Time in JavaScript, to improve my knowledge I decided to create my own calendar. It all began with a school exercise in Web development, but I was not happy with the calendar, I wanted to it better and more efficient than my classmates.  <a href='https://github.com/dorfingerjonas/calendar/'>Repository</a><i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i></p>

              <p>Ordersystem is a mobile app for waiters. In an organization-group for a big event each autumn we had a challenge that we had to deal with. The obstacle was, that the visitors at our event appeared at the same time, around 600 people wanted their food and drinks immediately. Every waiter has the app on his mobile phone and sends the order directly to the kitchen, there, some volunteers prepared the food. Other waiters served the food and drinks to the visitor. <a href='https://github.com/dorfingerjonas/ordersystem/'>Repository</a><i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i></p>

              <p>Design Dictionary is a website made for developers. It provides a collection of, in my opinion, good looking colors. Some friends are sending me colors which they think are looking good. Design Dictionary was created in the summer of 2019. I struggled when selecting my colors for Ordersystem, and decided to create this page, for me, but also for others to help them. If you have some nice colors, it would be a great pleasure for me to add your color to the collection as well. <a href='https://design-dictionary.github.io/'>Website</a><i class='fas fa-arrow-right'></i></p>
